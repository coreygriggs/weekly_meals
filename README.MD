## A flask app for keeping track of and planning meals

I wanted to build something that helps me to better organize ingredients for meals for a week so I don't inevitably forget groceries in the store.

Checklists and todo apps are great when I'm at the store, but aren't that helpful when planning out a week.


## Setup

Create a virtualenv. If you don't know how to, check out the link here: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/.

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Setup a config.yaml file. This is required for the project but gitignored. To run it, run the below command:

        $ python weekly_meals.py
